// Vampires and the sleeping man
// Consider a village with vampires and a sleeping man (who never wakes up, no matter what).
// A vampire can eat the sleeping man, but after eating him, the vampire falls asleep.
// Similarly, any vampire can eat any other sleeping vampire, and this process repeats.
// Assume that the vampires are very smart and would ALWAYS choose to stay alive than to eat the man and risk their lives.
// IF they feel it is safe to eat the sleeping man, that is the second priority 
// (for example, if there was only 1 vampire and 1 sleeping man, they would eat the sleeping man)
// Initially, there are 65 vampires and 1 sleeping man. What would happen in the village?
// Extra notes: don't consider anything from the outside world as an effect on this situation.
// Vampires cannot share the sleeping man... there has been fallout since Dracula died and they are not on good terms

no vampire will eat the sleeping man


# Card Flip Shuffle #
## You are in a dark room with a deck of cards. A certain number of the cards are face up and the rest are face down. 
## You can't see the cards. How do you divide the deck in to two piles with equal numbers of face up cards in each?
* You know how many cards are flipped, but you cannot see the deck of cards no matter what and the deck is shuffled, 
## so the flipped cards could be anywhere in the deck.




// Bonus riddle:
// John gave his brother James a box:
// About it there were many locks.
// James woke and said it gave him pain;
// So gave it back to John again.
// The box was not with lid supplied
// Yet caused two lids to open wide:
// And all these locks had never a key
// What kind of box, then, could it be?
